This code is for paper <A Linbreg method on Renewal System> using Matlab to run.

Here's a brief introduction of the paper:
We have presented an algorithm that is actually the well-known Linbreg algorithm to solve the renewal system problem. 
Especially it is applicable to solve multi-dimensional online task scheduling.
Compared to other kinds of Linbreg algorithms, our algorithm can achieve optimal values within a compact convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
We extend the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz(KL) properties in a more general way and provide a convergence proof of this algorithm under the stochastic framework with these KL properties, and roughly calculate its convergence rate.
Under certain conditions, its convergence rate can reach $O(K^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ or even faster, which is the same as other online learning algorithms. 
Additionally, we have conducted data simulations on specific examples. The algorithm not only solves more problems but also exhibits convergence speeds comparable to other algorithms.
